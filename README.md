## Open Nano Exchange (ONX) Protocol: A Decentralized, Asset-Backed NanoCurrency Exchange System

### Abstract

The ONX Protocol creates a decentralized settlment network of cryptocurrency exchanges based upon and using [Nano Currency technology](nano.org). It aims to establish a network of asset-backed NanoCurrencies like NanoDollars, NanoEuros, NanoBitcoin or NanoEthereum pegged to real-world or digital assets. This enables a distributed, decentralized, fee-free, near-instantaneous cross-border transaction system of exchange. ONX leverages the status given to any Principle Representative (PR) node within the Nano network to operate global consensus and standards, offering a profitable exchange business model for any entity running a PR. 

By offering an open and transparent system of exchanges, the protocol hopes to enhance security, decentralization, and promote wider adoption of Nano technology through more familiar fiat-pegged currencies or widely adopted digital assets. 

The objective of this living whitepaper is to address and solve the challanges of running an exchange protocol within specific jurisdictions and seed a movement of free open-source software platforms that operate ONX around the world, wherever they are needed. A reference ONX software platform which implements the protocol is included within this repository.
