# Introduction

The Open Nano Exchange (ONX) Protocol is built upon the solid foundation of [Nano technology](nano.org), leveraging its fast, feeless, and eco-friendly architecture. Nano's block-lattice structure, where each account has its own blockchain, enables near-instant transactions, making it an ideal platform for building a decentralized exchange system. In an industry where trust, interoperability and resilience are paramount, taking an open source and transparent approach to building a system of monetary exchange is critical. 

At the core of the ONX Protocol lies Nano's [Open Representative Voting (ORV) system](https://docs.nano.org/protocol-design/orv-consensus/), which is used to achieve consensus on the Nano network. In the ORV system, users can delegate their vote weight to representatives, who then participate in the consensus process by voting on the validity of transactions. The ONX Protocol utilizes this vote weight system to establish a network of NanoExchanges, operating asset-backed Nanocurrencies that operate on different network numbers within the Nano ecosystem.

Using this layer of consensus and trust, the ONX Protocol introduces a dual-currency system that consists of Nanocurrency, the core currency of the Nano network, and asset-backed nanocurrencies, which are pegged to fiat currencies and other crypto assets. These 'AB' (asset-backed) nanocurrencies, such as Nanodollars (XUSD) and Nanoeuros (XEUR), are pegged to their respective fiat currencies at a 1:1 ratio. AB nanocurrencies are designed to provide stability and familiarity for users and merchants who may be hesitant to deal directly with the volatility of cryptocurrencies.


Nanocurrency (XNO) serves as the primary currency for the ONX Protocol and the Nano ecosystem as a whole. It is used for transaction fees, liquidity provision, and as a base currency for trading pairs on NanoExchanges. Each of the AB Nanocurrencies retain all the features and benefits of the original Nano cryptocurrency, including fast and feeless transactions, eco-friendliness, and a secure block-lattice architecture. The ONX codebase powering each of the AB Nanocurrencies will track the development branches and implement changes and upgrades in lock step with the core Nano team's development repository.

NanoExchanges are responsible for issuing and managing AB nanocurrencies on their respective network numbers. The ONX Protocol establishes strict guidelines within the protocol to ensure that NanoExchanges adhere to these requirements and maintain the integrity of the AB nanocurrencies.

The dual-currency system of the ONX Protocol offers several benefits:
- It provides a stable and accessible entry point for users who are new to cryptocurrencies, as they can transact with familiar fiat-pegged nanocurrencies.
- It enables seamless cross-border transactions, as users can easily convert between different asset-backed nanocurrencies without the need for intermediaries or expensive fees.
- The dual-currency system creates a profitable model for NanoExchanges (who must also be Principle Representatives on the Nano network), as they can generate revenue through the conversion fees between Nanocurrency and asset-backed nanocurrencies.
