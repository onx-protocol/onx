# ONX Abstract

The ONX Protocol creates a decentralized settlment network of cryptocurrency exchanges based upon and using [Nano Currency technology](nano.org). It aims to establish a network of asset-backed nanocurrencies like NanoDollars, NanoEuros, NanoBitcoin or NanoEthereum pegged to real-world or digital assets for free and instantaneous cross-border transactions. ONX leverages the trust and reputation given to principle representative (PR) nodes within the Nano network to create global consensus and standardization, offering a profitable business model for any entity running a PR. By offering an open and transparent system of exchanges, the protocol hopes to enhance security, decentralization, and promote wider adoption of Nano technology through more familiar fiat-pegged currencies or widely adopted digital assets. 

The objective of this living whitepaper is to address and solve the challanges of running an exchange protocol within specific jurisdictions and seed a movement of free open-source software platforms that operate ONX around the world, wherever they are needed. A reference ONX software platform which implements the protocol is included within this repository.
